I am currently a lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University. My research focuses on intelligent systems, optimization, computational finance, urban planning, and data science. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong, focusing my doctoral research on collaborative neurodynamic approaches to multi-objective optimization and their applications in portfolio selection.

Throughout my career, I have published over 80 articles in prestigious journals and at international conferences. My recent projects have involved leading investigations into high-dimensional data analysis, utilizing artificial neural networks for advanced portfolio management, and developing mobile applications to enhance sustainability literacy.

In addition to my research, I contribute to the academic community as an Associate Editor for the journals Complex & Intelligent Systems and Intelligent Systems with Applications. I have also guest-edited special issues for several IEEE Transactions and other esteemed journals. My involvement extends to organizing international conferences, with a focus on advancements in computational intelligence and neural networks.

I welcome applications from prospective MPhil and PhD students. For more information about our programs, please visit the [Computing and Information Science MPhil/PhD page](https://www.aru.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/computer-science-research) on our department's website.
